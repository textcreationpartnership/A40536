            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the SIEGE of STETIN.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>STETIN</hi> as it hath been the Miracle of the Age, and Wonder of its Enemies, (for unparallell'd Courage and Resolution) ought now to be the Work of each ingenious Writer, and Discourse of every Martial Man. Fame has already spoke suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the publick praise of that undaunted City, whose Actions I now mean to particularize.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104415:9"/>
            <p>Whoever has read <hi>Mercator Atlas</hi> may be very well informed of the situation of <hi>Stetin:</hi> But for fear it might have scap'd the view of some of the Readers of this Piece, according to that Famous Author, I shall give you an account of it; and first of <hi>Pomerin</hi> or <hi>Pomerania:</hi> It is a Dukedom lying along the <hi>Eastern Sea,</hi> and is divided into two Parts, the Upper and the Lower, between which the <hi>Oder</hi> runneth: Lower <hi>Pomerain</hi> shooteth out <hi>Eastward,</hi> and contains in it the Country of the <hi>Vandals</hi> and <hi>Cassubans,</hi> Upper <hi>Pomerania</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth in it the Dukedom of <hi>Stetin</hi> and <hi>Wolgast.</hi> In both these Parts are many fine Towns, of which <hi>Bard</hi> is not the least. Some affirm that this Town took its name from the <hi>Longobards,</hi> others from the River <hi>Bartre,</hi> which lieth near unto it, and runneth into the Sea. The Dukes of <hi>Pomerin</hi> made this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104415:9"/> their Court or place of residence. It lieth three Dutch miles from <hi>Straelsond,</hi> seven from <hi>Rostock,</hi> and as many from <hi>Gripswaldt;</hi> from thence one may travail very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously to the Isle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> and into some other Isles of <hi>Denmark: Stetin</hi> is the cheif City in <hi>Pomerin,</hi> lying very pleasantly upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> and was so famous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, that the Dukes of <hi>Pomerin</hi> took their names from it: It is most certain that the <hi>Vandals,</hi> a wild and savage People, first Inhabited this Country. Some derive the name of <hi>Stetin</hi> from a certain People in <hi>Germany,</hi> called <hi>Sydenii,</hi> whereof <hi>Ptolomy</hi> makes mention. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Christian Faith, <hi>Anno one thousand one hundred and fifteen,</hi> by the means and help of <hi>Otho Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Bamberg, Wartislaus the Duke, and his Sons, then ordained a Bishoprick at Woollen, and founded</hi> St. <hi>Jame's Church in Stetin.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104415:10"/> The <hi>Oder</hi> there hath in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Bridges made over it, whereof the greatest and firmest is as you go into the Suburbs, near to which are many Garners of Corn, and divers Wharfs, where they build Shipping for the Sea, and Boats for their fresh Rivers: but the greatest of all is over the <hi>Oder</hi> upon the way to <hi>Dantzick,</hi> but to <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> on the <hi>Oder</hi> you must Sail, or be drawn up against the stream. The City is fortified round about with <hi>Walls, Turrets, Moats,</hi> and <hi>Gates,</hi> and lieth four-square: the principal Churches are St. <hi>Maries,</hi> St. <hi>Othos,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and others. There are divers Market places in it, as the <hi>Herb, Horse,</hi> and <hi>Fish markets.</hi> The Town-house stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hard by St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church in the <hi>New Market,</hi> from whence there go streets straight out right through the whole City: The greatest Beauty thereof is the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104415:10"/> or Prince's Court, which is built with such Art and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that none of the <hi>Italian</hi> Courts can equal it: <hi>Philippus</hi> and <hi>Barnimius</hi> Dukes of <hi>Pomerin,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected there an Illustrious School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, and bestowed upon it the Revenues of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and St. <hi>Othos</hi> Churches, and ordained four <hi>Curates</hi> and three <hi>Deacons</hi> over it. The first Duke was called <hi>Wartislaus the second,</hi> who died in the year of our Lord, 1222. he was the first that conquered the <hi>Vandals. Stetin</hi> also is accounted one of the cheifest <hi>Hans. Towns,</hi> and although the Prince holds his Court within the City, yet they have not the less Freedom. The Reformation of their Religion was first brought in by <hi>Paulus a Rhoda,</hi> sent thither by <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> when <hi>Bugislaus</hi> was Duke. <hi>Gustavus Adolphus Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> landed in <hi>Germany</hi> with his Army, <hi>Anno</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104415:11"/>
               <hi>Domini</hi> 1630. and after he had taken in <hi>Strael<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ond,</hi> made the first Conquest of <hi>Stetin,</hi> which has ever since belonged to the Crown of <hi>Sweden:</hi> And like true and Loyal Subjects, have pay'd their Homage to each successive Monarch. The whole Country is very fruitful, and the City is self Populous and Rich, and the Inhabitants of undaunted Resolutions, as this last Siege can sufficiently demonstrate.</p>
            <p>It may seem something doubtful to the Readers, how His <hi>Highness the Elector of Brandenburgh</hi> should make any Claim or Title to <hi>Stetin,</hi> especially so great as to be a motive for this present Siege: but because the Readers shall want nothing to give them a clear light into the former successions, according to that famous Cosmographer <hi>Doctor Heylyn,</hi> I shall give you this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104415:11"/>
            <p>The first Prince of <hi>Pomerin</hi> we meet with upon Record, was one <hi>Barnimus,</hi> who governed <hi>Anno</hi> 933. and after it passed from hand to hand, and became a divided State, Issue failing in the house of <hi>Otho</hi> the Third, who was co-partner with <hi>Bugislaus</hi> the Son of <hi>Barnimus,</hi> in the Government; that part was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, Marquess and <hi>Elector of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, which occasioned much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between these Marquesses &amp; the Dukes of <hi>Pomerania;</hi> yet it was at last concluded, That both Princes should continue the Arms and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and that the possession should be delivered to <hi>Bugislaus Duke of Pomerin,</hi> who dying without Issue Male, it descended to the Heirs of the <hi>Elector of Brandenburgh,</hi> who put in for the Inheritance according to the aforementioned Agreement, who at last made at the Treaty of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104415:12"/>
               <hi>Munster,</hi> after a tedious War in <hi>Germany</hi> with variable success, an other absolute Agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. after the <hi>Swedes</hi> having conquered <hi>Pomerania, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana</hi> sole Daughter of that brave Conquerour <hi>Gustavus Adolphus Magnus,</hi> but of the age of seven years, then Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> (the Kingdom being governed by the Nobless) agreed that she and her Successors, Kings and Queens of <hi>Sweden,</hi> should also be Kings and Queens of <hi>Stetin,</hi> as a place then belonging to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that the Lower <hi>Pomerania</hi> should belong to the house of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> Thus you find in part how the City came to be in the possession of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Right.</p>

               <head>The First Letter.</head>
               <p>HIs Highness the <hi>Elector of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> having had a long desire to bring this Town to his Subjection, (which was formerly his Predecessors) rais'd by the Aid and Authority of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> a considerable Army, who kept their Rendezvous at a place called <hi>Schooet,</hi> and not long after directed their March towards <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;</hi> and <hi>July</hi> the seventh 1677. covered it with an Army of near Twenty Thousand men, taking in the most considerable Posts, and raising Batteries along part of the <hi>Oder,</hi> by which he much gall'd the Shipping that anchor'd in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. On the other side, the <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiners</hi> were not idle, (having long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104415:13"/> expected a Siege) but sent away most of those People they thought might be unfitting for so weighty an Employment. The <hi>Elector</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intrench'd his Men, sent a Trumpet to the Town to demand a Surrender, and offer Honourable Conditions: But the Inhabitants, as well Burghers as common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with a unanimous Voice, and undaunted Resolutions, resolving to defend it to the utmost of their Lives and Fortunes, dispatch'd the Herauld with a Message not suiting his <hi>Highness</hi> desire, nor the hopes he had of an early Surrender, which made him prepare for Action. The next day his <hi>Highness</hi> laid a Bridge over an Arm of the <hi>Oder,</hi> and sent out a Party, who in a short time took <hi>Dam</hi> (a small Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Stetiners)</hi> and in it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a Captain (who had behaved himself very couragiously in the Action) with one hundred and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104415:13"/> forty men, who were attacked the next morning by five hundred men under the Command of Captain <hi>Vander-Noot,</hi> who in a short time retook <hi>Dam;</hi> but advancing too far, met with a <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, betwixt whom began a very sharp Dispute: But Captain <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Noot</hi> finding his Enemies press so eagerly upon him, was forc'd to retire, with the loss of about five and twenty men, besides one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, one Major, and about eighty common Souldiers dangerously wounded. During the time of this Action the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> were not idle, but made a passage through the Wood on the <hi>Moras</hi> as far as the <hi>Tolschans</hi> (a small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the <hi>Stetiners)</hi> and the next morning Major General <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> attack'd <hi>Plockhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104415:14"/> who after the <hi>Fort</hi> was taken, could not be satisfied but he would have the Life of the Major, whom he ran upon as vigorously as if he had been a Victor, in the action killing the Majors Horse, but was himself kill'd by one of the Major's men. The <hi>Fort</hi> being taken, the General order'd the Guns to be remov'd, and set Fire to the <hi>Fort,</hi> which was soon destroy'd. The next day the said Major attack'd the <hi>Tolschans,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commander not being able to defend, quitted; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first remov'd the Guns, and in his Retreat set fire to the Bridge, which was presently quench'd, and the Post taken in by the Major. The Besieg'd no whit daunted at these petty Losses, still continue their Resolutions, and prepare themselves for a General Assault, which they daily expect from the <hi>Elector's</hi> Troops.</p>

               <p>THe slow marching of the <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Troops</hi> has much retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the advancement of the Siege, which the <hi>Elector</hi> intends at their arrival to carry on with a great deal of vigor; in the mean time the Army is busie in Retrenching themselves, and have already begun to work upon the lines of <hi>Communication.</hi> There are daily Skirmishes between the Besiegers and the Besieged, but none of any moment until the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1677. on which on both sides were kill'd and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded near 200 men, the manner was as followeth: <hi>Captain Vander-Noot,</hi> and the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Tolschans</hi> manned several Boats, intending to interrupt the <hi>Pioneers,</hi> who were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104415:15"/> making retrenchments before the <hi>Vrowen-Port,</hi> (a considerable Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the <hi>Stetiners)</hi> but the said Pioneers had so well fortified themselves, and being strengthned by a Detachment of 400 men, they engaged the <hi>Stetiners,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom began a very sharp dispute; <hi>Capt. Vander-Noot</hi> and his men being forced to retire in a great deal of disorder, some were drowned in the <hi>Oder,</hi> others kill'd, and about thirty taken Prisoners. The same day the <hi>Lunen burgh Troops</hi> arrived, and had their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion designed before the <hi>Vrowen-Port:</hi> It was not long before they broke ground, for within three days they began to work upon their Lines of <hi>Communication,</hi> and prepared three Batteries, each to consist in sixteen or eighteen pieces of <hi>Cannon.</hi> In <hi>Dam</hi> and both Leaguers great provision? of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scines</hi> are making, and without any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104415:15"/> Demur they intend to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assault; in order to which, the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> is preparing six Batteries, each also to consist in sixteen or eighteen Pieces of Cannon. <hi>Provision, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> and <hi>Mortars</hi> come daily into the Camp, and nothing is wanting to compleat so great a work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> Major General <hi>Swerin,</hi> was advanced within five hundred paces of the <hi>Lastady,</hi> (an Important Post of the Besieged) from whence he intends to fling Granadoes into the Town. The same day the <hi>Elector of Brandenburg's</hi> Trenches were opened, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Horse were sent out, and took the Fort <hi>Lestoile,</hi> (a small Post of the Besieged) the <hi>Swedes</hi> had posted some <hi>Vessels</hi> in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to observe the motion of the <hi>Danes Frigates,</hi> who were engaged by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and after a sharp dispute, forced to retire. Next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104415:16"/> the <hi>Swedes</hi> engaged the <hi>Danes,</hi> and after two hours Fight fired one of them, and gave Chace to the rest; but were so hotly saluted by a <hi>Fort</hi> belonging to the Enemy, that they were forced to retire, and leave off that advantagious Chace. <hi>August</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> Major General <hi>Swerin</hi> began to make use of his Batteries, with which he did great execution: The Relation of which, though it may perhaps not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, will at least yield some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to those who desire every Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> the Major be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play upon that part of the Town where he was quartered against: And the first execution his Shot did (as near as can be guessed) was in parting a Fray: For a Black-Smith, a Souldier and Inhabitant of the Townlbeing new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from the Guard, and finding a man with his Wife, did very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104415:16"/> fairly and civily desire him to forbear, and resign his place to him; which without any reply he did, and so went away: the man not being able to put up this affront, taxed his Wife severely, and drag'd her out by the Hair of the head into the streets, where one Shot beat both their Brains out, and so ended the Fray; but not ending with the Shot, which had not done the mischief it intended, for in the same street it struck a Minister who was going to bury a Neighbour. The same Shot did a great deal more mischief, but not considerable nor pleasant enough to give you an account of it.</p>
               <p>The same day the Regiments of <hi>Gotz</hi> and <hi>Donhoff</hi> (two <hi>Danish</hi> Commanders) went into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and advanced their works the night following very considerably, with the loss only of fifteen Men, although the Besieged fired very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104415:17"/> furiously both with great and small Shot. The same day the <hi>Elector's</hi> Regiments entred the Trenches, and there lodged themselves. The eleventh, the Besieged made a Salley with three hundred Men, and in an hours Dispute beat <hi>Donhost's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments out of the Trenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but were soon forc'd to retire (Succours being sent by the <hi>Elector)</hi> with the loss of <hi>Twenty eight Men, one Captain, and two Corporals:</hi> The same day the great Battery that was begun the seventh instant, was ended, with the loss only of <hi>three or four Men,</hi> and the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were advanced about <hi>seventy Paces</hi> nearer the Town, where his <hi>Highness</hi> gave Orders for the raising of another Battery. The next night the Besieged made a Salley, but were repulsed without any considerable loss of either side. The fourteenth the <hi>Elector</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Fire upon the Town, upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104415:17"/> the Ships in the River, and upon the <hi>Lastadie,</hi> from five several Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: With which he did great Execution, sinking several of the Ships in the River, and making considerable Breaches in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stady.</hi> The same day he made use of his Mortars, and burned great part of the <hi>Suburbs.</hi> By Deserters that came from the Town, we were inform'd that our Shot had killed above <hi>hundred and fifty Burghers,</hi> and wounded <hi>Colonel Vander-Noot</hi> mortally. The next night we po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted our selves on the <hi>Molenbergh,</hi> (an other Post of the <hi>Stetiners)</hi> which is a hundred and fifty paces from the <hi>Counterscarp,</hi> upon which was erected three Batteries more, consisting in Thirty pieces of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>

               <p>THe 14th, the <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> fir'd from their Batteries as the day before, and in a short time sunk or so shatter'd most of the Ships in the River, that they were rendered useless. At night we fir'd our Granadoes into the Town, which caus'd two or three several Fires in the City, but were soon quench'd. The next morning about seven a Clock, we might plainly see the Steeple of the great Church in a Flame, which about two hours afterwards fell down, and fir'd the Body of the Church, which in a few hours was consum'd to Ashes. About noon His Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highness sent the Adjutant General with a Trumpet to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104415:18"/> Town, to tell the Burghers, that His Highness was much griev'd to see so fine a Church in a flame; and to admonish them to send out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to Treat with His Highness, assuring them they would find Him disposed to grant them very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Conditions. Being come to the Gate, and this Message de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, those that were there only answer'd, <hi>They were Resolv'd still to defend the Town.</hi> The same day three great Fires broke out in the City, in three several places: And by Deserters we had this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account of the Damage the City and Suburbs sustained by the Besiegers Cannons and Mortars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 14. We were saluted by the Cannon from the <hi>Elector's</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which much gall'd the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers and common Souldiers, and in less then six hours time there was near sixty of both sorts kill'd. The Women that had out of pure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104415:19"/> zeal stayed in the City, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their Husbands or Fathers, were stowed in Vaults and Cellars under ground, and by that means secured from the violence of the Shot. The Souldiers quartered in the <hi>Meal-Market</hi> were forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and take up their Quarters underneath the Stone Wall, where they were more secure then in the heart of the City. What Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our Cannon has done, we know not, but we guess consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for we could from the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarp</hi> see some of the <hi>Pranden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> Troops retire from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemberg;</hi> but what Execution was done by our Shot on the <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs</hi> side, we know not. About three the Cannons ceased playing, and then we made a Salley with three hundred men, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Execution: for besides the Men kill'd, they brought in twenty five common Souldiers, one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104415:19"/> Captain, and an Ensign, Prisoners. At night we were assaulted by the Mortars, which did great Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for besides firing the great Church, they set fire in three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the City, which Fires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed above sixty Houses before they could be quench'd; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd all they could to save the Church, but could not, for in less then five hours the whole Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was burnt to Ashes. The loss of this Church, and the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of unavoidable Ruine if they persisted in the Siege, and being out of any Hopes of Succour, they endeavoured to oblige the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to an early Surrender, and to procure good Conditions for them, laying before him the Misery they were like to be in if they continued stubborn: With this and the like supplications they moved the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour so far, as to obtain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from him, That if they were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104415:20"/> not relieved in a certain time, he would consent to all they should desire of him.</p>
               <p>Nothing of moment happened till the 20th, when at noon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged made a Salley, and attack'd the <hi>Elector's</hi> Out-Guards with great Resolution, but were repulsed; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them being kill'd, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taken Prisoners.</p>
               <p>The night following they made another Salley, with a Party of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were all chosen men; they fell upon the <hi>Elector's</hi> men that were in the Trenches, and both sides fought stoutly for some time; but the Besieged were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, leaving about twelve of their Companions dead behind them.</p>
               <p>Yesterday was finish'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt at the head of our Trenches, which will hinder the Besieged from making any more Sallies: The <hi>Elector</hi> is raising another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery near the Counterscarp, on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104415:20"/> which will be planted fifty Pieces of Cannon, whereof three will be whole Cannon, and shoot Bullets of sixty pound, nine will be forty eight pounders, and the rest will be half Cannon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 22. The <hi>Elector</hi> sent to the Town to demand a Surrender, and at the same time to relate the pity he had for 'em, and the grief he should endure to see so brave a People ruin'd, which they must inevitably be, if they persisted: but they still resolutely sent His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness word, They neither hoped his pity, nor feared his fury, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so well resolved within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that nothing but force should compel them to have a thought of Capitulation.</p>
               <p>By Deserters the <hi>Elector</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the People of <hi>Stetin</hi> had made it Death for any one to speak of a Surrender; and that they had put their Women and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104415:21"/> Children into places purposely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared under ground, to secure them from the Enemies Cannon and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, as well as to remove them from their Husbands and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so to take from them all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Tenderness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 24. About two in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the Besieged made a Salley with four hundred Horse on the side of the <hi>Lunenburgh's</hi> Quarter, whose Out-Guards were at first Repulsed, and a Captain and about seven or eight kill'd and wounded; after which, the Besieged retired again.</p>
               <p>In seven or eight days the great Battery will be finished, and then we doubt not to bring them to a Surrender: for we are already come so near with our Trenches, that our advanced Guards can talk with those in the Out-Works of the Besieged. The badness of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the plenty of the rain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104415:21"/> that hath fallen, has much retarded our progress in the Siege; our men not being able to work, or almost keep their Trenches, for fear of drowning: Which has much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd the Besieged, who prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by fair Promises, both from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and Count <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark.</hi> of a speedy Relief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue most resolute to defend the Place to the last Extremity, the Burghers doing Duty as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, which are not above fifteen hundred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 30. In the morning a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Besieged appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Works, but retired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecting any thing, finding no opportunity at that time. But the next day, befriended by the wet weather, the Besieged made a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The next day they attempted us again, but were forced to retire, with the loss only of five men, who were taken Prisoners. They all report that the Burghers do more service then the Garrison, and are even more resolute in the Defence of the Place. They also tell us that they had put the Governour in Prison, only for showing some inclination to a Treaty; and that a Burgher who let fall some words tending to a Peace, was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Market-place.

But on the side of the <hi>Lunenburgh's</hi> Quarter, the gaining of Ground proves a work of great difficulty, occasioned by the ill weather and continual rains they have had of late.

               <p>The same day the <hi>Elector</hi> sent a Trumpet with a Letter to the Town, to give the Besieged the News of the <hi>King of Denmarks</hi> being landed; and to admonish them to provide for themselves by Surrendring the place, whilst there was yet room left for it. To which they return'd for answer, That they were not to be taken with Letters and Advices; that if the Besiegers intended to become Masters of the Place, they must make their Attacks vigorously; and they on their side should not be wanting to defend themselves as well as they could.</p>
               <p>The 23. 24, and 25. we busied
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104415:27"/> our selves in springing and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Enemies Mines; which we did with such success, that we found an other Mine, which was made under the main body of our Works; and if sprang, had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less done great Execution: those Mines we sprung were with such success, that we posted our selves in three several places of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarp.</hi>

His <hi>Electoral</hi> Highness has deferred the general Assault, because there is not the least appearance of any Succours to come to the Besieged, which makes him willing to spend some more time in the Siege; not only hoping to bring them to a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104415:28"/> Surrender, but to spare his Men; although it is the general thoughts of all, that His <hi>Highness</hi> would hazzard an Assault (all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready for it) but that some of the Principal Officers are indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, especially <hi>Velt-Mareshall Dorfling.</hi>

               <p>NOthing of Moment passed on either side, till <hi>October</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> About four in the morning the Enemy sprung a Mine under one of the Lodgments we had made on the <hi>Counterscarp;</hi> which succeeded so well, that it buried all that were there; Several were kill'd, and about Fourty dig'd out alive, but most of them wounded past reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. The same day came a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter into the Camp, who assured us that the Besieged had lost a great many men, and that on the 27th past above a hundred Men were kill'd by the Enemy, and destroyed by their own Mines; and that, notwithstanding the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People would not hear of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104415:29"/> a Treaty: Some of the better sort of Inhabitants seemed desirous to save themselves and their Town from utter ruine, by a Capitulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 3. the <hi>Lunenburghs</hi> attack'd the <hi>Counterscarp,</hi> and in Four hours time made themselves Masters of it, and are preparing to descend into the Ditch to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Wall.</p>
               <p>The ill Weather comes on so fast, that it very much incommodes his <hi>Electoral Highness,</hi> and it is thought if the Army would but once begin their march in <hi>Livonia,</hi> and fall into <hi>Prussia,</hi> he would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those many advantages gained by him during the time of the Siege, be forced to raise it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecting so great and desired a work as the taking of <hi>Stetin.</hi> Those Burghers of <hi>Stetin</hi> which were most desirous of Peace, (we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Deserters) dare not shew it, for fear of being torn in pieces
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104415:29"/> by the multitude; which makes the Elector doubt much Blood will be spilt before the Town is taken.</p>
               <p>The fourth and fifth was spent in springing of Mines on both sides; the Besieged succeeding better on the <hi>Brandenburgh's</hi> Quarter, then on the <hi>Lunenburghs:</hi> For they a second time forc'd the Men posted and fortified on the <hi>Counterscarp,</hi> to retire with considerable loss, and made themselves Masters of the place, and maintained the same for two hours: at the end of which, the Besiegers sprung a Mine, which succeeded but in part; yet the breaking of the Ground kill'd about eighteen of those that were posted on the regain'd <hi>Counterscarp;</hi> which being followed with an attack, the <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> forced the Besieged to retire, and again posted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the <hi>Counterscarp.</hi> On the <hi>Lunenburgs</hi> side they prevailed not at all, although they made several
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104415:30"/> Salleys to hinder them from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For they have so well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themselves on the <hi>Counterscarp,</hi> that all the Vigor and Art imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cannot possibly remove them. The sixth, seventh, and eighth, the <hi>Lunenburghs</hi> busied themselves in making a descent into the Ditch, in order to the undermining the Wall. The <hi>Stetiners</hi> despairing of Relief, and yet unwilling to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, rather chose once more to supplicate <hi>Count Coningsmark,</hi> and to desire Succours from him, then to lose their Priviledge and Honour; to which they all assented, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd a messenger to the <hi>Count</hi> with Letters to that effect, the words were these.</p>

               <p>EVer since the 18th, we have been busied in laying a Gallery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ditch, which we have not as yet been able to accomplish, the great resistance of the Besieged mightily retarding so great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious a piece of Work. The 10th Instant early in the Morning, they made a Salley, and with such fury Attack'd the Pioneers and Souldiers, that they drove them from their Works, and tumbled down what they had done. The 12th they Sallied out again, with the same Success as before, which makes us almost doubt the Success of that piece of Work. The 15th in the Morning we sprung a Mine under a Ravelin near the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104415:34"/>
                  <hi>Holy-Ghost Gate,</hi> which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with an Attack, and in short time we made our selves Masters of the said Ravelin; in this Action we lost but seven Men, and the Besieged (as the Prisoners who scap'd the Powder and Sword af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) lost near thirty, besides one or two Principal Officers: The bad weather is a great hindrance to the Besiegers, yet they hope in a short time to end this troublesome Siege; The <hi>Lunenburghs</hi> advance daily for all the incommodity of the weather. The said 15th we prepared our selves for a general Assault, more to amuse the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, then any real intention, and to keep the <hi>Stetiners</hi> within their Works, that the Pioneers might finish the Gallery, which was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily perform'd: and now we doubt not but within two or three days to lodge our selves on the Town Walls. The Gallery being finish'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104415:34"/> we Attack'd the <hi>Stetiners</hi> in their Works, and after a small dispute; Lodged our selves in the Ditch, and had begun to set the Miner to the Walls of the Town. The 16th and 17th passed without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Action; and on the 18th, we had information by several Deserters, That the Principal Burghers (finding they could not expect to be relieved for all the <hi>Kings</hi> promises, and they must at last fall into the hands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector) think it better to make good Conditions for themselves by an early Surrender, then to expose all to the last extremity.</p>

In this Salley they also took two pieces of Cannon that were Planted at the foot of the Ditch, each shooting twenty four pound a piece, which they carried into the Town with them. The Besieged lost about one hundred Men, and <hi>Colonel Wangelin</hi> was there taken Prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 20th, the Besieged made another Salley with 300 Men, but found so brave a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, that they were forced to retire, though without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 25th, the Besieged made another Salley with three hundred Men, in which they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but little, for the <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104415:35"/> had Retrenched themselves so to advantage, that they were forced to retire.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 1st, His Electoral <hi>Highness</hi> sent Deputies into the Town to offer them favourable Capitulation, representing at the same time, That if they persisted in their obstinacy, they would draw an inevitable ruine on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104415:36"/> since they could not hope for any Succours.

               <p>The sixth about noon His <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> gave Orders for the springing the said Mine, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done, but not with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Success; the Besieged ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had notice of the intended Attack, had drawn the greatest part of the Garrison to defend their Works; His Electoral <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> lost in this Action a <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> and ten or twelve Men which were kill'd, besides twenty or thirty mortally wounded: the Miners are again at work in the said Bastion, in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of another, and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 7th, by Deserters who came out of the Town we are assured that there cannot be a more lamentable Spectacle, then to see the condition the Town is at present in, being buried in Ruines and Desolation; that since the Siege there has been kill'd near
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104415:37"/> 1400 <hi>Men, Women and Children,</hi> besides the Souldiers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison; and yet after all this loss, the Ruines of the City, and the presentation of unavoidable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Burghers persist in their obstinacy to defend the place to the utmost extremity. The same day His Electoral <hi>Highness</hi> took a review of the Forces he had left, which he found were not enough to carry it on with that vigour, as might be imagined must be used for the taking of the place, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving since his sitting down before it, lost beteewn 6 and 7000 Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those that are rendred useless, by reason of the sickness which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Camp. His <hi>Highness</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon sent to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to Assist him with some Men, in order to begin a General Assault, since his <hi>Highness</hi> thought nothing but that could put an end to the Siege; and as he was at present, it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104415:37"/> was too hazardous a piece of work, and might perhaps be the utter ruine of the whole business, and the loss of those many advantages he had already gained.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104415:40"/> and they declare before they will do it, they will all perish in the <hi>Oder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Deserter told us a strange and remarkable story which was, That a Principal Burgher and Officer being Posted on the Walls, his Servant came and brought him the news that his Wife and Children were killed in his house by a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball; which misfortune, though it nearly touched him, could not oblige him to quit his Post, but bidding his Servant return and take care to have them buried, remained in his station without any signs of trouble, declaring that he would with as little Concernment meet his own death, as he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood theirs.</p>

               <head>The Eight Letter.</head>
               <p>THe Besieged in <hi>Stetin</hi> defend themselves to admiration: Nothing is able to lessen their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Resolution. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all appearance, the <hi>Elector</hi> may be obliged to raise the Siege: for at present his Highness has not above ten thousand Foot, and the Cavalry especially are in a very bad condition; and that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Recruit</hi> he received of two thousand <hi>Danes,</hi> yet he is not in a Posture to give them a general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, though the Besieged daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novemb.</hi> 30. The Besieged made a Salley with three hundred men, and surpriz'd a small Man of War,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104415:41"/> or Galley, that lay in the <hi>Oder;</hi> the Captain happened to be kill'd, and the men being twenty four in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were carried into the Town. The <hi>Elector's</hi> Army is lessen'd by seven thousand men since he sat down before <hi>Stetin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since <hi>Novemb.</hi> 30. we had little or no Action till the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> nor no news from the Town of any moment, but that the Besieged, despairing of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the Army in <hi>Livonia,</hi> began to Mutiny, the Garrison with the Burghers, and all was in a kind of confusion, till Appeased by the discretion of the Governour, who gave them a Promise to come to an Honourable Capitulation, before they were Reduced to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Mean while the Elector is preparing to raise fresh Batteries, and to press the Siege with all the vigour imaginable; Resolving, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then not compleat so great a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104415:42"/> work, to lie before it all the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 4th, the Elector's Men gained a Post upon the Town Walls, though with the loss of sixty Men. In the mean time the <hi>Lunenburghs</hi> Attack'd the Bulwark and took it. The Besieged Attack'd the <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> three several times, but without any success; losing in the Actions between se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and eighty Men. These two Posts being taken in by the Besiegers, give the Besieged great jealousies of a General Assault, for which they are preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; having made so many Retrenchments within the Town, and fortified several Houses, filling them up with Earth, that in all likelihood it would yet require time to take the place; they being inabled to defend one part of the Town, whilst the Enemy should be possessed of the other.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:104415:42"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 2d. the Burghers received a new Charter from the <hi>King of Sweden,</hi> in which he grants them great Priviledges, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from all Taxes for many years to come. His <hi>Highness</hi> has given orders for several Regiments Quartered in the Countrey of <hi>Cleves,</hi> to repair forthwith to the Army to reinforce it. Till the 11th we had no Action of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor could we advance but very little, through the obstinate defence of the Besieged, who this night sprung three Mines, two of which did no great Execution, but the third, being on the side of the <hi>Lunenburgh's</hi> Quarter, destroy'd between fifty and sixty of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 12th the Elector caused two Mines to be sprung, which was followed by two At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks; in the first we were Repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the loss of fifteen Men, in the second we took a Post, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104415:43"/> maintained it: we are preparing two or three Batteries on that part of the Bulwark we are Masters of, as well as on the <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> side, which when finished, will do great Execution. In the mean time we hear nothing of a General Assault; our Generals looking upon it as too hazardous, considering the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition the Besieged were in; and even the Success would be attended with so much blood, as gives His <hi>Electoral Highness</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the thoughts of it. His <hi>Highness</hi> being advertised by a Person who came out of the Town, and had also been at the Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> That the Burghers and Garrison had not only Engag'd themselves anew (since the receipt of their last Charter) to defend the Town to the utmost; But assured His <hi>Electoral Highness,</hi> that the Works made by the Besieged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town, did not come short
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104415:43"/> of those he had seen in <hi>Candia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the Thirteenth and Fourteenth the Besieged made two vigorous Sallies, In which they succeeded so well, that they re-took part of the Bastion, and ruin'd the Enemies-works, that the Besiegers on that side retreated and lost Ground; but rallying again with new strength and vigor, fell upon the <hi>Stetiners;</hi> betwixt whom began a fierce Skirmish, it might almost be counted the Epitome of a civil War; their Fury and Courages were so great and equal, that it was long in Debate who should have the advantage of the Skirmish, but the <hi>Danes</hi> being so minutely assisted and recruited, obliged the others from their Post, who after the loss of fourty Men retired, and left their so early Conquest to the insulting Conquerours: and though they were repulsed here, yet they gained another advantage, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104415:44"/> drove the Enemy from the Post and Battery they had made on the Town-wall, where the seven Guns they had planted were removed, and dismounted by the Cannon of the Besieged, and the Souldiers posted there killed and taken Prisoners. This, though it be some encouragement and advantage to the Besieged, I fear will only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidate their time a little, and add more Glory to those raked up in Ashes, and the Ruines of so goodly a City, rather then bring Aid and Assistance to such brave Deservers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the sixteenth, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged having from a Post they held near the <hi>Holy Ghost Gate,</hi> very much incommoded the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs,</hi> His Highness caused the same to be attack'd. The Mine for that purpose being prepared, and the necessary Orders given, this afternoon we sprung the Mine, and followed it with a vigorous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104415:44"/> attack, but found it something hard to make our selves Masters of it, the Besieged fighting with so much Courage and Resolution; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they lost twenty seven men at the springing of the Mine, and the Breach we made was so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, yet for above an hour they kept us off, receiving our first shock with undaunted resolution; and indeed made us quit the Ground we had gained: but rallying again, they retired behind their Cannon, which was two pieces of Iron Guns shooting each six pounders, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Breach, and now promised our selves Possession, but were soon forc'd to retire; for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneers, whether by Orders, or prompted by their own Despairs, having charged with small Shot, Nails, and Rubbish, gave us so fatal a welcome, that we were forc'd at once to leave our conquest, and sixty Men dead, or mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104415:45"/> behind us. But rallying again, we made a third Attack, and in that succeeded so well, we secured the Guns, and fought so long with the <hi>Stetiners,</hi> till the Ensign that Commanded, and all (except twelve that were taken, and four that escaped into the Town) were kill'd upon the place. Those Prisoners we took informed us, that not long before <hi>Colonel Isensee,</hi> an eminent Officer, and well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by the Besieged, was kill'd. This Post being taken, we fortified our selves there, and raised a Battery of six pieces of Cannon.</p>

               <p>THe Constancy and Resolution of the Besieged cannot be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently extolled; it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly move, even the most void of tenderness, to hear the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion those that come thence make of the Ruines and Desolations there, and the Hardships the Inhabitants have chearfully undergone; who nevertheless for all their daily losses and calamities, do give new proofs of their Constancies and Courages, to that degree, as even to create an Admiration in their Enemies, who advance still, though very slowly; and they reckon the Town cannot hold out above a Month longer. The Elector for his part, is resolved not to raise the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104415:46"/> Siege till he be Master of the place!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 18th, the Elector sprung two Mines which did great Execution, and made not only a breach in the first Wall, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the stone Wall, so that one might see the Streets of the Town; which was followed with an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack by Two hundred Men, who after a sharp dispute, in which the Commanders were kill'd, and about Eighty common Souldiers kill'd and wounded, were Repulsed. The following night the Besieged fill'd up the Breach in the Stone Wall, and made several Retrenchments within: The next day the <hi>Elector</hi> caused another Attack to be made, in which the Besiegers posted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Elector upon this, sent a <hi>Herauld</hi> to demand the Town, and again offered them a very fair, honourable, and advantagious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, with an assurance to confirm all the Priviledges offered
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104415:46"/> to them by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and add more to 'em; but they were not accepted. The next day the Besiegers took two <hi>Galliots</hi> that lay in the <hi>Oder,</hi> and in them Forty Men, Six Guns, and several Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells of Powder; which will be of great use to the Besiegers, and much incommode the Besieged. The next morning early, His Electoral <hi>Highness</hi> caused a great Mine. (in which was Thirty Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to be sprung, which did not all the Execution desired or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the greatest part of the Earth falling backward; yet it made a small breach in the Town Wall, near the former, over against which the Besieged had made several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments within, and raised a Battery, which wholly hindred our following the Mine with an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. However we are preparing another Mine to make the said Breach larger, in order to an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104415:47"/> We are told by Deserters that came out of the Town, That of the Garrison there remains not Four hundred Men that can do any service; beside which, the Besieged begin to want Powder, which as well as other Considerations, it's believed will oblige them to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation: and the more, because the Burghers begin to mistrust the Souldiers of the Garrison; they having several times declared it was time to think of a Surrender: which the Burghers considering, and desparing of relief, have at length consented to. And the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Afternoon, sent a Letter to <hi>Major General Endten,</hi> signed by the Magistrates and Principal of the Burghers, to this effect.</p>

               <p>The Magistrates having receiv'd this Letter, soon concluded on a Peace; and next morning sent out Major General <hi>Plointin,</hi> Collonel <hi>Ishterit,</hi> and a Chief Commissary, as Hostages on their part for a Cessation of Arms, till the Peace or Capitulation was ratified: And the Elector on his part sent out Major General <hi>Leendorf,</hi> Collonel, <hi>Luke,</hi> and another Officer; and it is believed this day will put an end to the Siege. The Hostages being received on both sides, the Elector out of his generosity, pity, and indeed extremity of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, soon came to a Capitulation, and that much for the honour of the <hi>Stetiners;</hi> granting to them, notwithstanding the loss of men, which was computed to seven or eight thousand, and charge of money, (for it was found that it cost his Electoral Highness since this Siege, only in Powder, Cannon,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104415:50"/> great and small Shot, six thousand Crowns every day and night) all the Priviledges promised by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and had likewise added several new ones to them. The same night the Articles were drawn up, and sent to Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Wulsten</hi> Governour of <hi>Stetin,</hi> who insisted that the Garrison should be conducted to <hi>Straelsond,</hi> and that Major General <hi>Ludeque</hi> should remain a Prisoner, until such time as Collonel <hi>Wangelin</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his liberty; which his Electoral Highness absolutely refusing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to, the Treaty was broke off, and the Besieged recalled their Hostages, and sent back those of his Electoral Highness, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gave Orders to fire from all the Batteries into the Town, which was accordingly executed; and answered from the Town with all the vigor imaginable, neither the Besiegers nor the Besieged being
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104415:50"/> sparing of Pains, Art, Powder, or Shot: This firing lasted without cessation the following night, and part of the next day, which was the twenty sixth of <hi>December,</hi> when the Besieged sent out again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Treaty, and the next day the Secretary <hi>Flucks</hi> was sent into the Town, with the same Articles, which were that day signed on both sides, and the Capitulation totally ratified: The same day the <hi>New Gate</hi> was delivered up to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral Highness, and four Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions posted there. His Highness intends to make a solemn Entry into the place on the sixth day of the next Moneth, for which great preparations are making.

The Garrison which consisted in above three thousand Men, are reduced to about seven hundred Men; and of those scarce four hundred are able to bear Arms. His Electoral Highness found in the Town a fine Train of Artillery: It seems the Besieged wanted Powder, Salt, and Wood, which obliged them to surrender the place: however they obtained very honourable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104415:57"/> People, nothing can be more expected but the Order, Solemnity and Preparations; the Solemnity of the one, and the Order and Preparations of the other; which was perform'd with as much State, Honour and Obedience, as made their courtesie to the Conquerour, and their inveterate hate to their Enemy, shew like two Rival Stars. No eye, not so much as the most descerning, could descry the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Grandeur of the one, and the admired Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other; both being pois'd with such an equal hand, that the Gazers-on were not only struck with admiration, but almost wish'd themselves to be Captived by so brave and so obliging a Nation, who did with their wounds scarce dressed, or blood wiped off from their Visages, display at once the Sword, and innocent Banners of a certain Peace, as ready to serve
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104415:58"/> him with the one, as command their own safeties with the other. The Elector having settled the State of the War against <hi>Stetin,</hi> repaired the Wall and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were demolished, and put a strong Garrison into the Town, dispatched Letters to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> to direct Prince <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> and Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> to repair to the Camp, and accompany him in the solemn entry he will make into <hi>Stetin,</hi> on the sixth day of the next Month, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Homage of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Burghers.

Being entred the Gate, he was met by six Virgins in Mourning, who after Homage done to His <hi>Electoral Highness,</hi> presented him as follows.</p>
               <p>The First presented His Electoral Highness with a Cypress Wreath, with these words wrought in with threads of Gold, <hi>Victori Cruentatem Vinginitatem,</hi> A Bloody Virginity to the Victor.</p>
               <p>The Second presented his Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oral Highness with three Garlands in a gilded Scale, with this Motto,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104415:59"/>
                  <hi>Preces pro Benevolentia,</hi> (Prayers for Benevolence.)</p>
               <p>In each Garland is to be a little Hill of Myrth, and between the three Garlands a Cross, under which is written the word <hi>Prope,</hi> (Hard by.)</p>
               <p>The Third is to present to his Highness a Hat of Orange leaves, with this Motto, <hi>Paterna Virtute Auctam Augendam,</hi> Increased by the Fathers Valour, shall yet be greater.</p>
               <p>The Fourth will present to Prince <hi>Lodowick</hi> an Apple, on which is to be written with gilded Cloves, <hi>Natura Aetatem,</hi> (Nature brings Age.)</p>
               <p>The Fifth will present to Prince <hi>Phillip</hi> a Griffins Claw with this Motto, <hi>Perge sine mora &amp; habes,</hi> (Pursue without delay, and you shall have)</p>
               <p>The Sixth is to present to the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> a Nose-gay
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104415:60"/> of Flowers, with this Motto, <hi>Deo Gratias:</hi> then all with an unanimous voice repeated these Words, <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and long life to the Elector, and to all the Princes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of</hi> Stetin. After this he was met by the Magistrates and Chief Burghers of <hi>Stetin,</hi> all in mourning, who conducted him first to the Palace or antient Court of the Dukes of <hi>Stetin,</hi> and there after wishing him happiness and long life as before, they delivered up all the Ornaments, and things of State belonging to the City, and then took an Oath of Fidelity. From thence he was conducted to the great Church, and was there met by the Judges and Ministers, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, who all there took an Oath of Fidelity; from thence he was conducted to the <hi>Lastadie,</hi> which after the usual Ceremonies past, was delivered up to His Electoral Highness; from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104415:60"/> thence he came back again to the Court or Palace, where alighting from his Horse, twelve young Gentlewomen, the Principal in the Town, went before His Electoral Highness strewing green Herbs, and conducting him to the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-house, where he was magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently entertaintd at the Cost and Charge of the Magistrates and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers. It is but in vain to relate the manner, or the joy and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as well of the Electors Guards as of the <hi>Plebeans,</hi> both joyning together in a confused manner of acclamation. Dinner being ended, the usual Ceremonies over, and the due Homage received from the Magistrates and Burghers, His Electoral Highness, according to Military custom, return'd to his Quarters; and from thence, having settled all the affairs of <hi>Stetin</hi> in a peaceable order and due obedience, the tenth of this present <hi>January</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:104415:61"/> 1677. he returned to <hi>Berlin,</hi> and was received there with all the Solemnity and Magnificence that place is capable of, which was beyond what had been seen there in the memory of any man Living.</p>
